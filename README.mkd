Java Applet Embed plugin for WordPress
======================================

Description
-----------
Allows you to insert Java applets into your Wordpress blog.

If you've ever tried to embed a Java applet in a post or page by inserting
your usual `<applet>` or `<object>` tags, you would have noticed that
WordPress doesn't recognize the tags and the tags disappear. This plugin
supports new shortcodes permitting WordPress to recognize and properly render
the applets.

You can choose among three possible display modes:

1. Inline, loaded immediately
2. Inline, loaded only when the user clicks
3. Popup window, loaded only when the user clicks

You can reference your JAR archive with any full URL, even on another web
site.  And you can even upload the JAR into WordPress using the Media
Library and then reference the JAR file as you would any other image, video,
or audio.

It is based on the great work done by
[ahmattox](http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/ahmattox/) on his
[WordPress Processing Embed](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-processing-embed/).
In fact, it works almost exactly the same way and offers the same features.

For more details, including screenshots,
see the plugin's [page at wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/public/java-applet-embed/).
